# OpenVAS Vulnerability Managenet on Vulnerable Windows Vm in Azure

## Introduction
In this project I used MS Azure to setup and configre OpenVAS as my vulnerability scanner to explore the concept and practice of vulnerability management. In my enviorment I setup OpenVAS as my Scanner Deployed on Linux, and used a Windows 10 Virtual Machine as my PC to be scanned. On the Windows 10 pc I installed a few different outdated programs, and ran two typs of scans, a credentialed scan, and a non-credentialed scan to see what vulnerabilites would be identified by each type of scan.

## Scanning and findings
First I had to setup the VM to be scanned as a target, adding the IP of the target, and making sure the scanner was able to reach the target.

With the first scan not being a credentialed scan, the target only showed an overall medium score for overall vulnerability.

When I dove deeper into the report, I saw that the scanner was listing a few medium issues such as the pc having port 135 open, and the pc potentially being susceptable to a downgraded attack fom having older, less secure versions of TLS active which could be an issue if the encryption was broken, and data was sniffed from the connection by a third party.

After looking at the report, I went to verity the findings on the suspect pc and found out that the scanner was reporting a false-positive on the suspected use of older TLS version, as I connected to the VM and verified that the older version were not being used in internet properites or the registry.

To finish out the project, I ran my credentialed Scan and found several high alerts for my outdated software that was previously installed. The outdated installed sotware were older versions of these popular softwares: VLC Media Player, Adobe Reader, and Firefox browser. Since I was the one to install these out of date versions of this software, I knew that these Vunlerability alerts were true-positives. To remediate these vulnerabilites, I went into the Windows VM and un-installed/updated the vulnerable software. Upon updating and remediating the affected pc, I rescanned my Windows VM and found that the previouse vulnerabilites were no longer there indicating that the issues had been fixed, and the VM was secure again from those potential vulnerabilites.

## Conclusion
A software vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a computer, or program that can be exploited by hackers, potentially compromising the security of the system. In this lab I made use of tools to help solidify my knowledge of how to effectively scan, confim and remdediate vulnerabilites when present using OpenVAS as my scanner, and using Microsoft Azure as my enviroment where this lab was hosted. This lab helped me understand Vulnerability management, and how it is used in enviorments where security is a pillar of companies culture.
